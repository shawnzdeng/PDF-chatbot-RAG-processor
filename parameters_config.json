    "file_description": "The file is a set of lecture notes titled Machine Learning from Malla Reddy College of Engineering & Technology, designed for a final-year B.Tech course. It provides a comprehensive overview of machine learning fundamentals, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning; common models like decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines; ensemble methods; probabilistic models; and genetic algorithms. The material emphasizes both theoretical foundations (e.g., PAC learning, VC dimension) and practical applications.",
